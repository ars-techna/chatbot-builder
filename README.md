## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

First, you need to obtain the OpenAI API Key, which can be acquired from your [OpenAI Platform Account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

> **Note**: OpenAI encourages using environment variables for the API key. [Read more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).

### iOS setup

ChatBot Builder supports iOS 14.1+ and Xcode 12.1+. We are using CocoaPods as dependency manager. Add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ChatBotBuilder', :git => 'https://github.com/hexa-scribe/chatbot-builder.git', :tag => '0.0.1'
```

See the code snippet below on how to initialize and use the SDK in SwiftUI:

```swift
struct MyViewControllerWrapper: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> UIViewController {
        let defaultColorsBuilders = ChatBot.DefaultColorsBuilder()
            .setSendButtonColor(color: UIColor.purple)
            .setInputFieldFocusedIndicatorColor(color: UIColor.purple)
        
        let chatBot = ChatBot.Builder(apiKey: "YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY")
            .setDefaultColorsBuilder(defaultColorsBuilder: defaultColorsBuilders)
            .setDarkMode(isEnabled: false)
            .addMessage(role: .assistant, content: "Hi, how can I help you today?")
            .addPreSeededMessage(role: .assistant, content: "You are a helpful seller car assistant")
            .setInputFieldBorderWidth(borderWidth: 1)
            .build()
        
        return chatBot.getViewController()
    }

    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: UIViewController, context: Context) {
        // Implement this method if you need to update the UIViewController based on changes in SwiftUI
    }
}
```

### Android setup

Add the following line to import the library via Gradle. First, make sure Maven Central has been added:


```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // ...
}
```

Then, simply import the dependency to your `build.gradle` dependencies:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.hexascribe:chatbot-builder:0.0.1")
```

Take a look at the Kotlin code snippet below for an example of how to initialize and use the SDK:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChatScreen() {
    val chatBot = ChatBot.Builder("YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY")
        .setDarkMode(true)
        .addMessage(RoleEnum.ASSISTANT, "Hi, how can I help you today?")
        .addPreSeededMessage(RoleEnum.SYSTEM, "You are a helpful seller car assistant")
        .setInputFieldBorderWidth(1)
        .build()
    chatBot.ComposeScreen()
}
```
